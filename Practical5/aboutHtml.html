        HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to write Web Pages. Hypertext
        refers
        to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together. Thus, the link available on a webpage is
        called
        Hypertext. As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" a text
        document
        with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display. Originally, HTML was developed with the intent
        of
        defining the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of
        scientific information between researchers.</p>
